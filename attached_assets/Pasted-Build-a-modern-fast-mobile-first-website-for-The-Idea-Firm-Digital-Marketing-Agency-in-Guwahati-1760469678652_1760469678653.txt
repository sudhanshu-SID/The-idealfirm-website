Build a modern, fast, mobile-first website for “The Idea Firm — Digital Marketing Agency in Guwahati,” inspired by Brandingoo’s clean layout, big typographic sections, bold stats, and section-based storytelling; match the overall feel: dark background, high contrast, spacious grids, smooth scroll, and tasteful reveals.

Tech constraints: Frontend must be semantic HTML5 + modern CSS3 only (no React/UI frameworks) with vanilla JS solely for animations; Backend must be Node.js (v18+) with Express for form endpoints and email delivery via Nodemailer; deploy frontend and backend separately if needed.

Animations: Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger for section reveals, counters, and pinned hero elements; use Lenis for buttery smooth, GPU-accelerated scrolling synced with ScrollTrigger’s ticker for stable scroll-linked effects.

Content pillars (copy placeholders allowed):

Tagline: “Digital Marketing Agency in Guwahati — For all your digital marketing solutions” as the primary hero headline with strong CTA buttons (“Get Proposal” and “Book a Free Audit”).

Services section (grid, 2–3 columns desktop, 1–2 mobile): Digital Marketing Services; Google Ads Service in Guwahati; Facebook Ads Service in Guwahati; Web Designing Service in Guwahati; SEO Service in Guwahati; Social Media Marketing in Guwahati; Content Marketing Service in Guwahati.

Industries/clients worked for (icon grid taken from provided image): Educational Institutions, Real Estate, Exclusive Showrooms, Automobiles, Manufacturers, Hospitality; show each with circular icon cards and short captions.

Proof section: animated KPI counters (e.g., “Leads generated,” “Average ROI uplift,” “Campaigns delivered”), triggered on scroll and counting up once per view using GSAP.

Case studies/featured projects carousel or grid with image, problem → approach → outcomes (metrics-first), plus client logos row.

Testimonials slider (3–6 quotes) with client name and role, swipeable on mobile.

Contact/CTA band repeated every 2–3 sections with anchor to the contact form.

Information architecture and pages:

Home (sectioned single-page flow) with anchor links for Services, Industries, Work, Testimonials, Blog, and Contact.

Individual service landing pages for local SEO: /services/google-ads-guwahati, /services/facebook-ads-guwahati, /services/web-designing-guwahati, /services/seo-guwahati, /services/social-media-marketing-guwahati, /services/content-marketing-guwahati; each page needs benefit-led copy, FAQs, process steps, and a form.

Blog index (/blog) + blog post template for thought leadership and updates, even if initial posts are placeholders.

Contact page with map embed (static) and full form, plus WhatsApp/phone shortcuts.

Header and navigation: sticky, compact header with logo left, centered nav items (or right-aligned), and persistent primary CTA button; hamburger menu for mobile with slide-in panel.

Hero section: full-bleed, high-contrast hero with large H1 and supporting subhead; include two CTAs (primary solid, secondary outline) and an optional subtle background motion using GSAP for parallax/pin on large screens only.

Services section layout: stacked headings with service cards; each card shows an icon, short benefit list, and deep-link to corresponding service page; hover raises and adds soft shadow; reveal staggered on scroll.

Industries/clients section: use circular icon tiles from provided categories; present as a horizontally scrollable row on mobile and 3×2 grid on desktop; gentle fade/scale-in on intersection.

Case studies/work: grid of 3–6 items; each tile flips to show outcomes KPIs on hover; details page includes challenge, strategy, deliverables, outcomes with figures and screenshots.

Testimonials: simple card slider with auto-play and manual arrows; pause on hover; lazy-load avatars; ARIA roles for carousel controls.

Footer: NAP details (business name, Guwahati, Assam, India), quick links, services list, social links, and copyright; include a short secondary CTA and email capture form.

Visual system:

Color: dark background (#0E0E10 or similar), light text (#F3F4F6), accent (electric purple or teal) used sparingly for buttons and highlights; define CSS variables for colors and spacing.

Typography: modern grotesk/sans (e.g., Inter/Poppins) with large H1 (clamp), comfortable line-height, and clear hierarchy; use letter-spacing for section kicker labels.

Layout: CSS Grid/Flexbox; 12-column max container at ~1200–1280px, with generous section paddings; ensure comfortable touch targets on mobile.

Micro-interactions: link underline animations, button press depth, card hover scale 1.02 with 200–250ms transitions.

Animations implementation:

Initialize Lenis and sync with GSAP’s ScrollTrigger; limit heavy effects to desktop breakpoints; prefer fade/translateY 16–24px and staggered reveals; pin hero headline on large screens; animate counters when in view.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable non-essential animations when users opt out.

Forms and backend (Node.js/Express):

Endpoints: POST /api/contact and POST /api/quote; accept name, email, phone, company, service interest, message, source; validate/sanitize on server.

Email: send structured HTML email to agency inbox via Nodemailer (SMTP or API), with success/failure JSON responses; use environment variables for credentials.

Persistence: optionally store leads in MongoDB with createdAt timestamps and basic status field; return lead ID on success.

Security: rate-limit form posts, apply Helmet, validate inputs strictly, and include basic bot protection (honeypot + time-based challenge; optional reCAPTCHA).

Accessibility: semantic landmarks, alt text, color contrast ≥ WCAG AA, focus styles, ARIA labels on sliders and nav, and skip-to-content link; ensure keyboard operability for menus and carousels.

SEO and local SEO:

Semantic HTML with one H1 per page, descriptive meta titles/descriptions, Open Graph/Twitter tags, XML sitemap, and robots.txt.

JSON-LD LocalBusiness markup with “Guwahati, Assam, India” address and serviceArea; add FAQPage schema to service pages and Article schema to blog posts.

Internal linking from Home → service pages and related blog posts; optimize slugs for “service-in-guwahati” patterns.

Performance: ship critical CSS inline for above-the-fold, defer non-critical JS, lazy-load images with responsive srcset/WebP, compress assets, and target sub-3s LCP on 4G; avoid layout shift by reserving media dimensions.

Deliverables:

Frontend file structure: /public (index.html, services/.html, blog/.html, images/, css/styles.css, js/main.js, js/animations.js).

Backend file structure: /server (server.js, routes/forms.js, controllers/forms.js, utils/mailer.js), .env.example, package.json with scripts dev/start; include README with setup and deploy steps.

Deployment targets: host static frontend on Netlify/Vercel; host Node/Express backend on Render/Railway/DigitalOcean; configure CORS for frontend domain; set environment variables for SMTP/API keys securely.

QA checklist: test scroll/animation smoothness, form validation and email delivery, rate-limiting, responsiveness across breakpoints, lighthouse scores (Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90), and SEO metadata for each service page.

Visual references and assets: align overall feel to Brandingoo’s section rhythm, stat emphasis, and service-first messaging; use the attached Services and Industries images as style references for iconography and grouping during design.

Notes on libraries and setup
Use the official GSAP ScrollTrigger patterns for pinning, scrub, and view-based triggers to keep animations performant and easy to maintain.

Initialize Lenis and sync it with GSAP’s ticker exactly as documented to avoid jank and keep scroll-based effects in lockstep.

Follow MDN’s Express form-handling flow for GET/POST, validation, and error reporting; return JSON and show inline error states on the client.

Use Nodemailer with SMTP/API and environment variables, testing with a sandbox provider first before switching to production credentials.
